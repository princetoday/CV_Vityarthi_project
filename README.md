Smart Image Quality Analyzer

> **A command-line Computer Vision project for automatic image-quality assessment using OpenCV and NumPy.**


---

##  Overview

**Smart Image Quality Analyzer** is a lightweight Computer Vision application that evaluates the quality of digital images without requiring a graphical user interface.

The application analyzes four important image characteristics:

- ☀️ **Brightness**
- ◐ **Contrast**
- 🔎 **Sharpness**
- 📡 **Noise**

These measurements are converted into quality scores and combined into an **overall score from 0 to 100**. The application then assigns a quality classification and provides practical recommendations when quality problems are detected.

The project supports both **single-image analysis** and **batch analysis of an entire folder**, with results automatically exported to a JSON report.

# 🚀 Installation

## 1️⃣ Open the project directory

Open PowerShell or the VS Code terminal inside:

```text
image-quality-analyzer
```

## 2️⃣ Create a virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

## 3️⃣ Activate the virtual environment

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After activation, your terminal should look similar to:

```text
(.venv) PS C:\...\image-quality-analyzer>
```

---

# ▶️ Usage

##  Analyze a Single Image

Run:

```powershell
python main.py --input data/sample/sharp.jpg
```

The terminal displays the detected metrics, quality score, classification, and recommendations.

### Example terminal output

```text
========================================
       IMAGE QUALITY ANALYZER
========================================
----------------------------------------
File: data\sample\sharp.jpg
Brightness: 102.15
Contrast: 123.63
Sharpness: 1169.23
Noise: 0.07

Class: Excellent
Recommendations:
- No major quality problem detected.

Report saved to: outputs\report.json
```

> **Note:** Exact values depend on the input image.

---

##  Analyze an Entire Folder

The application can process all supported images inside a folder.

```powershell
python main.py --input data/sample
```

##  Generate a Custom JSON Report

The default report location is:

```text
outputs/report.json
```

A custom location can be supplied using `--output`:

```powershell
python main.py --input data/sample --output outputs/my_report.json
```

---

# 📊 Quality Analysis

## ☀️ 1. Brightness

Brightness represents the average intensity of the image.

Very low brightness can indicate an underexposed or dark image, while very high brightness can indicate an overexposed image.

---

## ◐ 2. Contrast

Contrast measures variation between intensity values in the image.

Low contrast can make an image appear flat and reduce the visual separation between objects and their background.

---

## 🔎 3. Sharpness

Sharpness is estimated using the **variance of the Laplacian**.

The basic idea is:

```text
Image
  ↓
Convert to grayscale
  ↓
Laplacian operation
  ↓
Calculate variance
  ↓
Sharpness estimate
```

Higher Laplacian variance generally indicates stronger edges and more visible detail.

---

## 📡 4. Noise

Noise is estimated from local intensity variation.

Higher unwanted variation can indicate increased image noise, which may reduce perceived quality.

---

# 🧮 Quality Scoring

The individual measurements are converted into component scores and combined into an overall quality score.

```text
Brightness ──┐
Contrast ────┤
Sharpness ───┼──→ Overall Quality Score → Classification
Noise ───────┘
```

The final score is reported on a **0–100 scale**.

### Classification

| Overall Score | Classification |
|---:|:---|
| 🟢 **80–100** | **Excellent** |
| 🔵 **60–79.99** | **Good** |
| 🟡 **40–59.99** | **Fair** |
| 🔴 **Below 40** | **Poor** |

---

# 💡 Recommendations

The application does more than calculate numbers.

It checks the measurements and generates recommendations such as:

```text
Image may be too dark. Consider increasing exposure.
```

```text
Low contrast detected.
```

```text
Low sharpness detected. Check focus or camera movement.
```

When no major issue is detected:

```text
No major quality problem detected.
```

---

# 📦 JSON Report

The analyzer produces a structured JSON file containing the analysis results.

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "file": "data\\sample\\sharp.jpg",
        "resolution": {
            "width": 600,
            "height": 400
        },
        "metrics": {
            "brightness": 102.15,
            "contrast": 123.63,
            "sharpness": 1169.23,
            "noise": 0.07
        },
        "scores": {
            "brightness": 0.0,
            "contrast": 1.0,
            "sharpness": 1.0,
            "noise": 0.9998,
            "overall": 94.9
        },
        "label": "Excellent",
        "recommendations": [
            "No major quality problem detected."
        ]
    }
]
```

> The numerical values change according to the analyzed image.

# ⚠️ Limitations

- This project is intended for general image-quality assessment.
- The quality score is a heuristic measurement rather than an absolute professional image-quality standard.
- Results depend on the characteristics of the input image.
- Different types of images may produce different metric ranges.
- The current application uses a command-line interface rather than a graphical interface.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible extensions include:

- 📈 Additional image-quality metrics
- 🧠 More advanced noise estimation
- ⚙️ Configurable scoring thresholds
- 🖼️ Support for additional image formats
- 📊 Visualization of quality measurements
- 🧪 More extensive automated testing
- 🔄 Comparative analysis between images
- 📑 More detailed report generation
